Introduce Euclid's Postulate
Pause at the fifth postulate
    Point out that it's quite complicated compared to the rest
    Point out equivalent postulate:
> The sum of three angles on a triangle add up to exactly a half turn around a circle

Mathematicians have been trying to prove it as a **consequence** of the other four for millenia.
This came to a head in the 1700s, when


Now we may modify this axiom in two ways:
1. If the sum of a triangle's angles is greater than \tau/2
2. If the sum of a triangle's angles is lesser than \tau/2

We introduce the **Correction Constant** \( \Eta \)
\[
    \Eta := {Sum of angles} - \Tau/2
\]
If \( \Eta \) everywhere 


For a traingle of Area A, it has the correction constant
\[
    \Eta = R^2 / A^2
\]
