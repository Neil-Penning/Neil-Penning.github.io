# Summary
This is a regular 20 sided figure, known as a Platonic Icosahedron.
It is hollow and caged, so you can see the ball inside.

# Instructions
I used Wolfram Alpha pro to generate an icosahedron STL file.
Then, I imported it into sketchup, made it hollow and put a ball inside.
Finally, I used Microsoft's STL fixer to repair my design.
