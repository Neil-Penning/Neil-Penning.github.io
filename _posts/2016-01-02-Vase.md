# Future Note
Back in 2016, I created a Vase in OpenSCAD. 
[Here's the Gist for it](https://gist.github.com/Neil-Penning/09ac448332e3e727fee22d5156f76280)
The following is copy-pasted from the [thingiverse link](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:784764):

# Summary
This vase allows you to create the perfect fit to complement your household.
With almost every aspect customizable, it can be tailored to any need, whether for pencils, flowers, or even just decoration.
# Instructions
I created an openscad script that generated an n-pointed star. From there I used the `linear_extrude` function to make it twist and scale.
Unfortunately, the code is very messy. Sorry.
Update 1: Made code neater, added twist, scale, and bottom height options

Update 2: Fixed bottom height option, made scale work properly

Update 3: Allowed counter clockwise rotations

Update 4: I made the bottom flush with the rest of the vase.
