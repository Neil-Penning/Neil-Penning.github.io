## Rename [Proper Adjectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_adjective)

I firmly believe that proper adjectives obfuscate helpful information about the mathematical object at hand.

So, we rename `Abel`ian group to `Abel`'s commutative group

G is a commutative group -> G is one of Abel's commutative groups
G is Abelian -> G is commutative

{x} is a Cauchy sequence -> {x} is one of Cauchy's Shrinking Sequences
{x} is a Cauchy sequence -> {x} is a shrinking Sequences

I prefer this term over OP's "gravitating sequence" because shrinking refers to the distance from the previous element.
We can't use "convergent", as not all Cauchy sequences converge in the rationals.

### Examples
Here is a list of examples I've been toying with. Not all are my own.
A few are clever, a few are clunky, and the rest fall somewhere in between.
I couldn't come up with a name for all of them, so there's a couple "fill in the blank"s

Do I use all of these? No. Here are the ones that I use, because, in my opinion, they greatly increase the clarity of the subject at hand.
- Euler's every-vertex cycle / path
- Hamilton's every-edge path
- Hausdorff's separated space
- Lie's manifold groups
- Mathieu's 4-sharp group
- Mathieu's 5-sharp group
- Sylow's guaranteed p-subgroup

I'm particularly fond of the 4-sharp and 5-sharp group's names, because they are unique properties of their respective groups.
Every-vertex paths and Every-edge paths remove the lookup time in my brain during conversations, so I find them useful.


## Exceptions:
We run into problems when Proper Adjectives are incorporated into noun phrases. For instance, Computationally Universal is a noun phrase synonymous to [Turing Completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness), but English doesn't let us stick a Proper possessive in there - as the following sentence:
```
Mov is Turing Complete 
```
(For context, [here](https://drwho.virtadpt.net/files/mov.pdf) is an excellent paper.)
We have to instead say
```
Mov is one of Turing's Universally Computable Instruction Sets
```
This case is prototypical of a couple exceptions; where an author introduces a new fundamentally new concept to mathematics, and our language adopts their name to be synonymous with this concept.
Off the top of my head, there are a couple other examples:
- [Euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean)
- [Pythagorean Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem)
- [Ricci Flat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricci-flat_manifold)
- [Turing Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness)

The Euclidean axioms are about 2000 years old, so this adjective predates English, Middle English, and Anglo-Saxon. These terms are linguistically synonymous.
The Pythagorean theorem, while not discovered by Pythagoras, is similarly ingrained in the way we speak about angles.
